## **01** : ChefRee
ChefRee is a fictional website containing recipes for cooking food: *"The stuff folks eat!"*

#### PRE-PROJECT NOTES [23 JAN 2023]
This project, as I presently understand it, is to lay out a skeleton for this website in HTML. There will, by assignment, be a homepage that links out to any of several individual recipes. I expect to be making repeated use of the `<a>` tag, as well as really hammering in the boilerplate document setup & formatting.
